# Java Programming: Arrays, Lists, and Structured Data
This course is offered at Coursera and is part of the [Java Programming and Software Engineering Fundamentals](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/java-programming).

This is the second course of the Specialization, [Link to the course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/java-programming-arrays-lists-data?specialization=java-programming).

**Notice:** Some code should be run in a custom Bluej Development Environment made by Duke's University especially for this course. The IDE from the University website is [here](https://www.dukelearntoprogram.com//downloads/bluej.php?course=2).

# Project in the course
Use these data structures to build more complex programs that use Javaâ€™s object-oriented features.\
Write an encryption program and a program to break the encryption algorithm.

# Course Purpose
1. Read and write data from/to files.
2. Solve problems involving data files.
3. Perform quantitative analyses of data (e.g., finding maximums, minimums, averages).
4. Store and manipulate data in an array or ArrayList.
5. Combine multiple classes to solve larger problems.
6. Use iterables and collections (including maps) in Java.
